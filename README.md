## Key Features
* **Multi-Class Diagnosis:** Detects 12 conditions including Acne, Melanoma, Eczema, and Psoriasis.
* **Advanced AI Model:** Powered by **EfficientNetB1** using Transfer Learning, trained on a merged dataset of ~16,000 clinical and dermoscopic images.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Implements automated **Class Weights** to accurately detect rare diseases (e.g., Cancer) despite dataset imbalance.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Built-in camera support allows users to analyze skin lesions directly from their phone.
* **Smart Analysis:** Provides a top prediction along with "Second Best Guesses" and confidence scores.
